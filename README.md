Carbon Footprint/Local Sourcing : 
Products with a lower carbon footprint contribute less to climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Sourcing materials locally also supports sustainable practices by reducing transportation emissions and encouraging local economies. This is weighted heavily because it directly impacts a product’s environmental and community impact.

Disposability and Waste Management (15%)
How a product is disposed of or recycled greatly influences its environmental footprint at the end of its life. Products designed for recyclability or composting help reduce landfill waste and resource loss. This is weighted moderately because it affects the product lifecycle but occurs after its primary use.
Durability (10%)
A durable product lasts longer, reducing the need for frequent replacements and conserving resources. Emphasizing durability ensures better value for consumers and decreases the overall environmental impact of production cycles. It has a lower weight since it complements other factors like materials and production
Packaging Type (10%)
Packaging is important for reducing waste, especially if it is minimal, recyclable, or biodegradable. However, its impact is usually smaller compared to the product’s materials and manufacturing processes. This is why it is weighted the lowest, though still considered crucial for sustainability. 
Ingredient/Material Rating (25%)
The materials in a product are critical for sustainability, as they influence resource depletion, toxicity, and renewability. Opting for eco-friendly materials, like recycled or biodegradable components, reduces environmental harm. This category is weighted highest because it impacts every stage of the product lifecycle, from sourcing to end-of-life disposal.
Packaging Type (10%)
Packaging is essential for product protection, but excessive or non-recyclable packaging increases waste and pollution. Sustainable packaging options, such as minimal, compostable, or recyclable materials, help reduce the environmental footprint. It has a lower weight because its impact is often secondary to the materials and production of the product itself. 



Each criterion is scored on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most sustainable. The final eco-rating is a weighted average of these scores.
